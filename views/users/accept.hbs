      <h3>
      Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore<br>

      <p>
        Dear {{userData.username}},<br>
        We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardary.
        Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await
        your owl by no later than 31 July.
        <br>
        As a muggleborn (witch or wizard with non-magical parents), we realise that this might be surprising for you.
        Many of our new muggleborn students have difficulty finding their school supplies and knowing where to go.
        In previous years we would simply take bets on which muggleborn family would have a nervous breakdown when they
        first encountered a goblin, however, this year after much pressure for certain more sensible members of staff, we 
        have employed a few web designers to make an "app" to help muggleborn students adapt to our world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yours sincerely,
        <br>
        <br>
        Minerva McGonagall
        <br>
        Deputy Headmistress
      </p>
